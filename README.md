# <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
    Escape The Room is a small and simple puzzle game written in Unreal Engine 4 
	and C++. The purpose of the game was to learn how to create a small, yet 
	functional game in which the player is place in a room and must figure out 
	how to escape through the locked door. The player can move certain items 
	pressing the "F" key or the left mouse button.

	The game was created through with the use of Unreal Engine 4, Blueprint, 
	Visual Studio 2015, and C++. The player starts out in an enclosed room with 
	nothing but a couch, a table, two chairs and a locked door. The player will 
	naturally see the door and try to figure out how to get through it. They 
	must find and satisfy a pressure plate with a weight requirement in order to 
	escape the room. Upon looking around, the player might notice a small shade 
	of red in a corner denoting some importance. This marks a pressure plate 
	that is only satisfied by the weight of the player, or a combination of 
	other items in the room. It is up to the player to find the right 
	combination of items to hold the door open and allow them to reach freedom.

	With more time, I would like to further expand upon the game. For starters, 
	I would like to create a more complex level, with more of a horror astethic. 
	I believe this would instill a sense of need to escape for the player. One 
	simple thing I could do is add more items to the room and edit the pressure 
	plate to not only have a minimum weight requirement, but also have the door 
	close upon passing a weight limit. This could be done by adding a range 
	within the pressure plate's requirements say from 180lbs-190lbs, and only 
	having a certain combination of items match that combined weight. Another 
	expansion would be to actually have the door lead somewhere, maybe have the 
	player exploring a building trying to find out why they are there and how to 
	find their way out.
